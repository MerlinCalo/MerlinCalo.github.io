		<p>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/MerlinCalo">Merlin Calo</a> I am a <a href="webdesignerm3d.com">web designer</a>. I have an Arts background, and started out with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/merlincalo">Design</a> back in 97. I am currently enrolled in the <a href="http://rampup.startupinstitute.com/">RampUp</a> Boston, Front End Developer Cohort through the Startup Institute. I am interested in becoming a better front-end coder, and learn enough to be dangerous.
