		<p>My name is Merlin Calo I am web designer. I have an Arts background, and started out with Graphic Design back in 97. Currently I am enrolled in the RampUp Program Boston, Front End Developer Cohort through the Startup Institute. I am interested in becoming a better front-end coder, and learn enough to be dangerous.
